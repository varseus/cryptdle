; Tokenomics ;
 - A crypt is a 1 to 12 character string
 - Initial pool of 100 crypts, each valued at 1 coindle
 - Every day at 9am EST a new a crypt is chosen at weighted random (according to value) from the pool
 - Every 10 minutes a hint is made public
 - First to solve the crypt has the ability to mint and transact a NFTdle
   - If the solver declines, the NFTdle is minted and gifted to the developer
   - The crypt is archived
 - Any who solve the crypt has the ability to transact 1/2 of its current coindle value
 - Solvers may spend coindles to publish crypts to the pool
   - A crypt's value is the amount of coindles spent on it
   - Explicit words are outlawed
 - An additional 0.2% of all coindles is minted everyday and given to the publishers of the day's crypt
   - Publishers are awarded reduced amounts if their crypt is guessed very early or late
